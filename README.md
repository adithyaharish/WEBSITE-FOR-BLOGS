# WEBSITE-FOR-BLOGS
this project uses flask as framework  and couchdb as database to develop a public website similar to blogs.

NOTE:
A sample video of the website is attached. Do go through it for better idea
I have hosted my couchdb in cloud to deploy the website, hence that part of the code is hashed for security reasons. 
i have also attached the templates and html fils for easy reference.

FEATURES:
1. login,logout along with forget password option( sends a reset password page to your mail).
2. ability to view the post's author details.
3. responsive design in PC and mobile
4. only the author can edit or delete his/her posts
5. unregistered useers can view the blog, and only regeistered users can create one.
